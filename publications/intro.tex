I have co-authored 63 scientific articles intended for peer-reviewed publication,
including 7 first-author papers. They have been cited more than 2,800 times and
have an $h$-index of 31, with more than 250 citations on my first-author papers.
My publications include three companion reviews on galaxy alignments written for a
special issue of Space Science Reviews (B.\ Joachimi et al.\ 2015, A.\ Kiessling
et al.\ 2015, D.\ Kirk et al.\ 2015). The full list of publications is summarized
below, and can be accessed at \href{https://goo.gl/LAu9G4}{this url}. I also wrote
an invited `News \& Views' article for the 4 July 2017 edition of Nature
Astronomy, accessible

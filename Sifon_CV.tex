\sectitle{Research Interests}

My research focuses on galaxy cluster physics including observable--mass scaling 
relations for cosmological analyses, brightest cluster galaxies, the mass 
content of cluster galaxies, and merging clusters. I am also interested in 
intrinsic galaxy alignments, both as contaminants for cosmic shear and as a 
physical mechanism in their own right. I use various tools and techniques to 
study these phenomena, including weak gravitational lensing, spectroscopy, the 
exploitation of optical surveys in general, and most recently also of
hydrodynamical simulations.

\subsectitle{Successful Observing Proposals (as PI)}

%\noindent
%I have been the PI of 9 different successful observing proposals in 5 different telescopes:
%
%\noindent
%\itemdate{Magellan/FourStar} (2020AB,2019AB) 6 nights for near-infrared imaging of galaxy clusters\\
%\itemdate{Very Large Array} (2019A) 4.5 h to study AGN feedback in galaxy clusters\\
%\itemdate{Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope} (2017B,2013B) 44 h to study diffuse radio emission in clusters\\
%\itemdate{Gemini South/GMOS} (2017B) 24 h for optical imaging and spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxy clusters\\
%\itemdate{VLT Survey Telescope/OmegaCAM} (2015A) 6 h for optical imaging of galaxy clusters\\

\noindent
I have been the PI of 12 successful observing proposals totalling hundreds of 
observing hours in optical (Gemini-South/GMOS, VST/OmegaCAM), near-infrared 
(Magellan/Fourstar), submm (APEX/CONCERTO), and radio (GMRT, VLA) telescopes.

\technical{Observing Experience}
{I have spent roughly 180 hours observing with 
optical (Gemini South/GMOS) and near-infrared (NTT/SofI, Magellan/Fourstar) instruments performing both 
imaging and spectroscopy of galaxy clusters.}

\sectitle{Technical skills}

I am an experienced \texttt{python} programmer, and I also have some experience 
with IRAF/PyRAF. I have written {\tt pygmos}, a Python/PyRAF pipeline to reduce 
Gemini-GMOS spectra which is available 
\href{https://github.com/cristobal-sifon/pygmos/}{\texttt{here}}. I also 
developed an early analysis pipeline for the FLAMINGOS-II infrared imager and 
spectrograph installed in the Gemini-South telescope. I am one of three lead 
developers and maintainers of the galaxy-galaxy lensing pipeline used by the 
KiDS collaboration (written in \texttt{python}, but which is not public at the 
moment). Other codes I have written are posted at my 
\href{https://github.com/cristobal-sifon}{\texttt{github}} page.\\

\sectitle{Research Interests}

My research focuses on galaxy cluster physics including observable--mass scaling relations for cosmological analyses, brightest cluster galaxies, the mass content of cluster galaxies, and merging clusters. I am also interested in intrinsic galaxy alignments, both as contaminants for cosmic shear and as a physical mechanism in their own right. I use various tools and techniques to study these phenomena, including weak gravitational lensing, spectroscopy, the exploitation of optical surveys in general, and most recently analyses involving hydrodynamical simulations.

\sectitle{Successful Observing Proposals (as PI)}

\noindent
I have been the PI of 6 different successful observing proposals in 5 different telescopes:

\noindent
\itemdate{Magellan/FourStar} (2019A) 0.5 nights for near-infrared imaging of galaxy clusters\\
\itemdate{Very Large Array} (2019A) 4.5 h to study AGN feedback in galaxy clusters\\

\itemdate{Gemini South/GMOS} (2017B) 24 h for optical imaging and spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxy clusters\\
\itemdate{VLT Survey Telescope/OmegaCAM} (2015A) 6 h for optical imaging of galaxy clusters\\


\technical{Observing Experience}
{I have spent roughly 180 hours observing with 
optical (Gemini South/GMOS) and near-infrared (La Silla-2.2m) instruments performing both 
imaging and spectroscopy of galaxy clusters.}

\sectitle{Technical skills}

I am an experienced \texttt{python} programmer, and I also have some experience with IRAF/PyRAF. I have written {\tt pygmos}, a Python/PyRAF pipeline to reduce Gemini-GMOS spectra which is available \href{https://github.com/cristobal-sifon/pygmos/}{\texttt{here}}. I also developed an early analysis pipeline for the FLAMINGOS-II infrared imager and spectrograph installed in the Gemini-South telescope. I am one of three lead developers and maintainers of the galaxy-galaxy lensing pipeline used by the KiDS collaboration (written in \texttt{python}, but which is not public at the moment). Other codes I have written are posted at my \href{https://github.com/cristobal-sifon}{\texttt{github}} page.\\
